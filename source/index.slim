        h2 Why aura ?
    .four.columns
      p There are many ways to develop Javascript applications, and almost as many frameworks.
      p Bug giving your application a structure that stays safe and scales gracefully along your application requires expertise and foresight.
      p So many apps get rewritten over and over again because you only see their flaws looking back.

    .four.columns
      p Aura implements a set of proved patterns and organizes them so you can rest assured that your code does not turn into spaghetti over time, while trying to stay framework-agnostic
      p Aura is a decoupled, event-driven architecture for developing widget-based applications.
      p Aura introduces proven patterns and best practices for developing maintainable applications, while giving you greater control over widget-based applications.
      p Aura gives you complete control of a widget's lifecycle, allowing developers to dynamically start, stop, reload and clean-up parts of their application as needed.
      p The project is based on concepts discussed by Nicholas Zakas in Scalable Application Architecture and by Addy in Large-scale Application Development.
